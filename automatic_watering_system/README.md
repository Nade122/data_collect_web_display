# Automatic Watering System #

Arduino IDE ESP8266 example to upload data to and be controlled by a custom web service.

### How to start ###

Please review the "config.h" and adjust the necessary settings for your network.
Program your ESP8266 board and run it. It will automatically set all used variables on your web interface, so you will be able to view data and controll the device.

### Additional notes ###

I have not yet tested this thoroughly, so please let me know if you have any issues or suggestions.
